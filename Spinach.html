    <p> Spinach is a 17-year-old teenage girl who is 5'7 3/4. She enjoys kidnapping childern, 
        eating people and listening to the serial podcast. She is an alpha and friendly, but can also be very violent and a bit unintelligent.
        I own 4 guinea pigs, 2 cats, and 2 dogs. Spinach hopes to become a Whale Marine Biologist or a stripper. Who knows. :P <br><br>

    <p> Spinach is the leftover canned spinach Popeye didn't want. Adopted from Thailand and moved to Virginia, USA when she was 5 years old. 
        On the trip over she kicked the mans chair infront of her for most of the 30hr trip. He was not happy with her. (: When Spinach was 5
        years old, she slipped on a banana and it changed her life. Spinach also useed to overfeed her fishes so she could watch long strings of poop
        but they ended up dying. Not to brag but Spinach is not only a serial killer of humans but kinda a goldfish killer too. </p>
